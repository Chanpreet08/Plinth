            Distraction IUPC is an IUPC-style programming contest crossed with various distractions (you will get to know when you enter in the contest arena!), where teams of three people try to solve as many programming problems as they can. Meanwhile, our Distraction Team will be doing what they can to make the job of programming more difficult and/or enjoyable.\n

            Line follower robots were one of the earliest automatic guided robots. They are able to follow a line marked on a contrasting background, usually a black line on a white surface or vice-versa. For Beginners it is usually their first robot to play with. It’s the most basic example of adding small intelligence to a robot, but it’s actually the designer’s intelligence!
            \n\nOur event goals: Fun while Learning, Sharing, and Teamwork….Winning is secondary.\n

            For all those who believe in setting the place on fire! Here’s a live experience of a racing tournament. Build your own robot and come on board!\n
            \nRobotics as a whole is a competition where people can showcase their technical skills. RoboRace is a competition where couple of Robots compete with each other in their speed and accurate control.\n
            1.Construct Your Machine to have the maximum speed to beat another machines on the given track to reach the final destination in minimum time.\n
            2.You have to build a manually controlled robot capable of traversing over different terrain and unseen hurdles.\n
            3.There will be separate points for overcoming the obstacles as well as the other parameter being within time. Thus the bot with the most cumulative points will win.\n
            4.The aim of the event is to check the robustness of the vehicle and its competence with the opponent on the same track.\n

          As the name very well suggests, SIF aims at bringing the budding startups and the aspiring students all under one umbrella. Here, the associated startups would be able to find just the right intern for their company whether it be for summers ,winters or workfrom-home. On the other hand, the students would be able to apply their acquired skills and broaden their technical horizons, by working in a thriving startup environment. The process would be an aggregated one and the students would be screened on the spot and would get the opportunity to land up amidst some cool entrepreneurs.\n

            Our inboxes are usually spammed with emails from internship and training websites. With the startup boom in our country, fresh ideas are launching every day. They definitely need creative problem-solvers, out-of-the-box thinkers, who share the same vision as that of the company. Applying through virtual platforms is tedious and time-consuming. With multiple screening rounds, group discussions etc, the wait to hire the perfect candidate gets even longer! This is why we present to you SIF. We here at the Startup Intern Fair would open the gates of entrepreneurship to a lot of creative minds. Thus, to bridge the gap between the talent-seekers and the talented, we present Startup Intern Fair in its very second edition at PLINTH\'17, the annual techno-management literary fest of LNMIIT\n
